## Description



## Installation

npm install

## Issues

There are no issues at this time.

## User Story

AS an average Joe 
<br/>
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
<br/>
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
<br/>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I GIVEN a text editor web application
<br/>
WHEN I open my application in my editor
<br/>
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
<br/>
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
<br/>
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
<br/>
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
<br/>
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
<br/>
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
<br/>
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
<br/>
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
<br/>
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
<br/>
WHEN I open the text editor
<br/>
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
<br/>
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
<br/>
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
<br/>
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
<br/>
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
<br/>
WHEN I click on the Install button
<br/>
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
<br/>
WHEN I load my web application
<br/>
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
<br/>
WHEN I register a service worker
<br/>
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
<br/>
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
<br/>
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
<br/>
